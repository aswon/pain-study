    The slider works by calculating the distance between two marker objects.
    The smaller the distance, the smaller the resulting output. To create a
    slider increasing from left to right, for example, set one marker on the
    left, and have the participant hold the marker in his hand. As the marker
    is moved to the right, the distance will increase, and thus the slider
    value will also increase.
